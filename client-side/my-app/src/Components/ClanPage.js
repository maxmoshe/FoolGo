<br/>all penguins are born equal
<br/>all penguins must aid eachother in the time of need, as our strength comes in numbers and not in power.

<br/><b><u>History</u></b>
<br/><b>part one: background</b>
<br/>A long long time ago, in a time almost forgotten by history, there was an era where penguins and bears lived in peace and harmony, in a kingdom called ikartica where bear and penguin where considered equa. bears and penguins befriended, lived with and even married each other and the business of the great fish market was thriving. It was a time when a penguin could walk the cold wasteland of iktartica without the worry of being an hungry polar bear's next meal.
<br/>Times could not have been better. Yes, one could say we were living in one of those places that you can only find in the scriptures from one of the great penguinosophers. All was good and well.
<br/>But that was soon to change.
<br/><b>part two: one bear's plan</b>
<br/>in the midst of the 19th century, a new ideology has developed, called "social pangwinism"
named after the pengiologist Chalres Pangwin. inspired by this new way of thought, some cultures in the kingdom of ikartica, namely the bears, have began to believe that perhaps not all races were created equal after all. This created a lot of new tensions between the once tranquil bear-penguin kingdom.
<br/>In the middle of all of this, there was one bear who was distinguishable from all the others:
Herbert P. Bear.

<br/>Herbert bear was a white polar bear. From a very young age, Bear had an interest in painting, and so he sought a proffesional career in the subject. After being rejected twice by the academy, Herbert has began to look for a scapegoat to hate on rather than put the blame on himself for his own lack of skill and proficiency. Naturally, as penguin-bear tensions were in their peak, and seeing that the head of the academy who was responsible for his repeated rejections was a penguin, Herbert knew who he had to blame for his problems - the penguins.
<br/>He knew someone had to do something about those vile, greedy, pesky penguins. Five years later Herbert P. Bear has became head of the national Pazi party and elected Puherer of the third Peich.
